# Plant Disease Classification

Plant Disease Classification is a computer vision project focused on detecting and classifying plant diseases using deep learning techniques. 
The study utilizes the New Plant Diseases Dataset from Kaggle, which contains over 87,000 labeled leaf images across 38 classes, and selects 12 specific classes from apple, grape, and corn plants for experimentation. 
The project implements five pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures—EfficientNetV2B0, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and VGG16—to classify leaf images into healthy or diseased categories. 
The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

This project aims to compare the performance of multiple deep learning models in plant disease detection and demonstrate how transfer learning can improve classification accuracy in agricultural applications.
